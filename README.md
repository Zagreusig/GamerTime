This is just a little game I'm making to continue to further my understanding of C code.

The premise is a text adventure game that uses simple combat mechanics, status effects and items.
There can be "trick" items that appear *almost* normal, but are jester items that give a negative effect, there is a tell.
Example:
NORMAL
    AMAZING ITEM!
    ~Flavor text~
      Stat 1
      Stat 2
    
  ~Flavor text~

JESTER
  AMAZEING IITEM!
  ~Flavor text~
    Stat 1
    Stat 2

  ~Flavor text~
